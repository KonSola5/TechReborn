# Tech Reborn: Fine, I'll do it myself

*Tech Reborn is a not-so-standalone tech mod that normally chases versions, not caring about versions that players actually play on.*


### Recommended Releases
Play whatever version of Minecraft you like!

The mod will be eventually posted and maintained only on 1.18.2, 1.19.2 and 1.20.1.
